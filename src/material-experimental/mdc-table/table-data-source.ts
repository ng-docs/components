/**
 * Data source that accepts a client-side data array and includes native support of filtering,
 * sorting (using MatSort), and pagination (using MatPaginator).
 *
 * Allows for sort customization by overriding sortingDataAccessor, which defines how data
 * properties are accessed. Also allows for filter customization by overriding filterTermAccessor,
 * which defines how row data is converted to a string for filter matching.
 *
 * **Note:** This class is meant to be a simple data source to help you get started. As such
 * it isn't equipped to handle some more advanced cases like robust i18n support or server-side
 * interactions. If your app needs to support more advanced use cases, consider implementing your
 * own `DataSource`.

# Migrating to MDC-based Angular Material Components

In Angular Material v15, many of the components have been refactored to be based on the official
[Material Design Components for Web (MDC)](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web).
The components from the following imports have been refactored:

| Import path | Summary of changes |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| @angular/material/autocomplete | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/button | Style changes, API changes |
| @angular/material/card | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/checkbox | Style changes, changes to event behavior |
| @angular/material/chips | Complete rewrite |
| @angular/material/core | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/dialog | Style changes, changes to change detection behavior |
| @angular/material/form-field | Style changes, some appearances removed, API changes |
| @angular/material/input | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/list | Style changes, API changes |
| @angular/material/menu | Style changes, API changes |
| @angular/material/paginator | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/progress-bar | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/progress-spinner | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/radio | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/select | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/slide-toggle | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/slider | Complete rewrite |
| @angular/material/snack-bar | Style changes, API changes |
| @angular/material/table | Style changes only |
| @angular/material/tabs | Style changes, API changes |
| @angular/material/tooltip | Style changes only |

The refactored components offer several benefits over the old implementations, including:

* Improved accessibility
* Better adherence to the Material Design spec
* Faster adoption of future versions of the Material Design spec, due to being based on common
  infrastructure

## What has changed?

The new components have different internal DOM and CSS styles. However, most of the TypeScript APIs
and component/directive selectors for the new components have been kept as close as possible to the
old implementation. This makes it straightforward to migrate your application and get it running
with the new components.

Due to the new DOM and CSS, you will likely find that some styles in your application need to be
adjusted, particularly if your CSS is overriding styles on internal elements on any of the migrated
components.

There are a few components with larger changes to their APIs that were necessary in order to
integrate with MDC. These components include:

* form-field
* chips
* slider
* list

See below for a [comprehensive list of changes](#comprehensive-list-of-changes) for all components.

The old implementation of each new component is now deprecated, but still available from a "legacy"
import. For example, you can import the old `mat-button` implementation can be used by importing the
legacy button module.

```ts
import {MatLegacyButtonModule} from '@angular/material/legacy-button';
```

## How to Migrate

You can start your migration by running Angular Material's automated refactoring tool. This tool,
implemented as an [Angular Schematic](https://angular.io/guide/schematics), updates the majority
your code to the new component versions. While some follow-up is necessary, you can reduce the
manual effort by following these best practices:

You can reduce the amount of manual effort needed by ensuring that your application follows good
practices before migrating.

* Avoid overriding styles on internal Angular Material elements in your CSS as much as possible. If
  you find yourself frequently overriding styles on internal elements, consider using a component
  that is designed for more style customization, such as the ones available in the
  [Angular CDK](/cdk).
* Use [component harnesses](/guide/using-component-harnesses) to interact with Angular Material
  components in tests rather than inspecting internal elements, properties, or methods of the
  component. Using component harnesses makes your tests easier to understand and more robust to
  changes in Angular Material

### 1. Update to Angular Material v15

Angular Material includes a schematic to help migrate applications to use the new MDC-based
components. To get started, upgrade your application to Angular Material 15.

```shell
ng update @angular/material^15
```

As part of this update, a schematic will run to automatically move your application to use the
"legacy" imports containing the old component implementations. This provides a quick path to getting
your application running on v15 with minimal manual changes.

### 2. Run the migration tool

After upgrading to v15, you can run the migration tool to switch from the legacy component
implementations to the new MDC-based ones.

```shell
ng generate @angular/material:mdc-migration
```

This command updates your TypeScript, styles, and templates to the new implementations, updating as
much as it can automatically.

#### Running a Partial Migration

Depending on the size and complexity of your application, you may want to migrate a single component
or small group of components at a time, rather than all components at once.

You may also want to migrate your app one module at a time instead of all together. You can use both
the old implementation and new implementation in the same application, as long as they aren't used
in the same `NgModule`.

The script will prompt you for the directory and components you want to migrate.

### 3. Check for TODOs left by the migration tool.

In situations where the migration tool is not able to automatically update your code, it will
attempt to add comments for a human to follow up. These TODO comments follow a common format, so
they can be easily identified.

```ts
// TODO(mdc-migration): ...
```

To search for all comments left by the migration tool, search for `TODO(mdc-migration):` in your
IDE.

### 4. Verify Your Application

After running the migration and addressing the TODOs, manually verify that everything is working
correctly.

Run your tests and confirm that they pass. It's possible that your tests depended on internal DOM or
async timing details of the old component implementations and may need to be updated. If you find
you need to update some tests, consider using [component harnesses](./using-component-harnesses) to
make the tests more robust.

Run your application and verify that the new components look right. Due to the changes in internal
DOM and CSS of the components, you may need to tweak some of your application's styles.

## Comprehensive List of Changes

### Library-wide Changes

* Component size, color, spacing, shadows, and animations all change slightly across the board.
  These changes generally improve spec-compliance and accessibility.

* The DOM structure for all components has changed to improve accessibility and better follow the
  Material Design spec.

* CSS classes applied to components use the `mat-mdc-` prefix, whereas before it was simply a `mat-`
  prefix. Elements that roughly correspond to element in the old implementation have been given the
  same class name (aside from the prefix). For example, the button’s host class is `mat-mdc-button`
  instead of `mat-button`. However, not all elements in the previous implementation have an
  equivalent element in the new implementation.

### Theming

### 主题

* Default typography levels defined by `mat.define-typography-config` have been updated to reflect
  changes to the Material Design spec.

* All components now have themeable density. Styles for the default density level (0) will be
  included by default when you include a theme mixin.

  ```scss
  @import '@angular/material' as mat;

  $theme: mat.define-light-theme((
    color: ...
  ));

  // Adds density level 0 styles
  @include mat.all-component-themes($theme);
  ```

  If you prefer a different default density level, you can set it in your theme config:

  <!-- TODO(wagnermaciel): link to density docs for more info once they exist. -->

  ```scss
  $theme: mat.define-light-theme((
    color: ...,
    density: -1
  ));
  ```

### Autocomplete

* Long options now wrap instead of truncating.

* Option heights are no longer capped at `48px`.

* Option list now has an `8px` top and bottom padding.

* Options list now has an animation when opening and closing.

### Button

* Icon button height and width are `48px` instead of `40px`.

* State colors (hover, focus, active) are slightly different to improve text contrast ratios.

* Letter-spacing is `1.25px` instead of `normal`.

* FAB supports text with the `extended` input attribute.

* Theming mixins are split into three separate mixins:
  - Normal button (default, raised, stroked, flat): `mat.mdc-button-theme`
  - Icon button: `mat.mdc-icon-button-theme`
  - FAB: `mat.mdc-fab-theme`

* Icons in the button content are placed before the button text. Add the `iconPositionEnd` attribute to place them after the button text.

* Icons in the button content inherit the text `font-size`. Buttons with only icons and no text do
  not align properly (this does not apply to the icon-button).

### Card

* By default, mat-card does not apply any internal padding. Instead, this padding is defined on the
  card content areas: `<mat-card-content>`, `<mat-card-header>`, and `<mat-card-actions>`.

* `<mat-card-content>` no longer sets any typography styles, users are free to add whatever
  typography styles make sense for their application, either to `<mat-card-content>` itself or any
  child elements as appropriate. For example:

  ```scss
  @use '@angular/material' as mat;
  @include mat.typography-hierarchy();
  ```

  ```html
  <mat-card>
    <mat-card-content class="mat-body-1">...</mat-card-content>
  </mat-card>
  ```

### Checkbox

* Clicks on the checkbox now trigger directly on the native checkbox element rather than a shim div.
  Native checkboxes have bizarre behavior when calling `preventDefault` on their `click` event, so
  users should not call `preventDefault` on `click`.

* Checkbox touch targets are larger, now 40px instead of 16px, which is more accessible. Be sure to
  allow enough space in your layout so that the touch target does not overlap other components. If
  you are not concerned with accessibility you can match the previous size by using density -1 for
  the checkbox.

  ```scss
  @use '@angular/material' as mat;
  @include mat.checkbox-density(-1);
  ```

* Checkbox color may be changed to white or black due to a change in heuristics based on the
  application’s theme. Previously, the check’s color would be set to the theme’s background color.
  With MDC, it is determined by whether white or black has the most contrast against the primary
  color.

* Focus state is slightly darker, improving contrast ratio.

* Text styles are not inherited; you will need to specifically target the checkbox’s `label` to
  override typography properties.

* After toggling a checkbox with the mouse, the ripple will remain visible instead of animating out.

### Chips

* The chips component has been split into multiple variants corresponding with more appropriate
  interaction patterns for accessibility. The original `mat-chip-list` used `role="listbox"`, but
  this interaction pattern is not suited for all use-cases. The new chips have:

  * `<mat-chip-listbox>` with `<mat-chip-option>` - this is the closest to the previous interaction
    pattern. This is the only variant that supports selection state for chips. This pattern aligns
    with the filter chips pattern specified in the Material Design spec. This pattern should be used
    when you want the user to select one or more values from a list of options.

  * `<mat-chip-grid>` with `<mat-chip-row>` - this pattern should be used for any text input + chips
    interaction.

  * `<mat-chip-set>` with `<mat-chip>` - this variant has no accessibility pattern and assumes one
    will be applied at the application level. This allows the application to implement a custom
    accessibility pattern with the chips visuals.

* The migration tool always changes the legacy `<mat-chip-list>` to `<mat-chip-listbox>` to minimize
   differences before and after. You should separately consider changing to `<mat-chip-grid>` or
   `<mat-chip-set>` on a case-by-case basis. See [Chips Interaction Patterns](/components/chips/overview#interaction-patterns) for more guidence on
   choosing the appropriate component for your use case.

### Dialog

* The `.mat-dialog-container` does not contain a 24px padding anymore. Instead, the inner dialog
  directives are responsible for adding the right padding. This will be apparent if your dialog does
  not use any of the directives like `<mat-dialog-content>`.

* `mat-dialog-content` uses the font-settings specified by the Material Design spec, which includes
  a rather roomy line-height. If you have an information-dense dialog that doesn't look good with
  these settings, you can avoid using `<mat-dialog-content>` and just use a div with custom padding,
  or use custom typography settings that can be applied with the `mat.mdc-dialog-typography` mixin.

* The old dialog triggered an extra change detection, which may have masked change detection issues
  in your application that need to be fixed when migrating.

### Form Field

* The "legacy" and "standard" form-field appearance settings no longer exist, as these have been
  dropped from the Material Design spec.

* The removed "legacy" appearance promoted input placeholders to the floating label if the label was
  not specified. All newer appearance settings require explicitly specifying a `<mat-label>` if one
  was not provided before. This change addresses an accessibility best practice of not using labels
  and placeholders interchangeably.

* By default, MatFormField still reserves exactly one line of space below the field for hint or
  error text. However, there is a new option `@Input() subscriptSizing: 'fixed'|'dynamic'`. When
  this setting is set to `fixed` (default), the form-field reserves enough space in the layout to
  show one line of hint or error text. When set to `dynamic`, the form-field expands and contracts
  the amount of space it takes in the layout to fit the error / hint that is currently shown.

* The text inside `<mat-hint>` is larger and darker in order to meet W3C text guidelines.

* While the previous form-field had a single directive for prefixes (`matPrefix`) and a single
  directive for suffixes (`matSuffix`), the MDC-based form-field distinguishes between text
  prefix/suffixes which are baseline aligned with the input text, and icon prefix/suffixes which are
  center aligned in the form-field. Use `matTextPrefix` or `matTextSuffix` to indicate a text
  prefix/suffix, and `matIconPrefix` or `matIconSuffix` to indicate an icon prefix/suffix. The old
  `matSuffix` and `matPrefix` APIs will behave like icons, though they are now deprecated.

* The `floatLabel` input no longer accepts `'never'`. `floatLabel="never"` was only supported by the
  legacy form-field appearance which has been dropped. It was used to achieve a floating label that
  behaved like a placeholder. If you need this behavior, use the `placeholder` property on `<input>`
  instead.

* Custom form field controls may need their styles adjusted to account for the fact that the
  surrounding form field DOM and styles have changed.

### Input

* MatInput must be inside `<mat-form-field>`. Previously it was (unintentionally) possible to use an
  `<input matInput>` without the form field if the page loaded form field styles elsewhere.

* The MDC-based MatInput hides the native calendar picker indicator associated with
  `<input matInput type="date">`, if you want this indicator to appear for your inputs, use the
  following styles:

  ```scss
  .mat-mdc-input-element::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator {
    display: block;
  }
  ```

### List

* The API has been reworked to support text wrapping and better integration with the Material Design
  specification.

* Previously, list items were commonly created using multiple `span` elements with the `matLine`
  directive applied. Each `span` resulting in a line, and the first one becoming the primary line.
  With the new API, the `matLine` directive has been split into two more granular and meaningful
  directives:
  * `matListItemTitle`
  * `matListItemLine`

* Text outside of a `matListItemLine` (so-called "unscoped content") will result in an additional
  line being acquired (as if the content was put into a line).

  ```html
  <mat-list-item>
    <span matListItemTitle>Title</span>
    Second line
  </mat-list-item>
  ```

* The list automatically infers the number of lines of text content. For example, in the snippet
  above, the list item renders space for two lines. With the new API, you can set an explicit number
  of lines on the `<mat-list-item>` to manually control wrapping.

  ```html
  <mat-list-item lines="3">
    <span matListItemTitle>Title</span>
    This text will wrap into the third line. Space for three lines is acquired by the
    list item.
  </mat-list-item>
  ```

  Note that text inside a `matListItemTitle` or `matListItemLine` will never wrap. Only unscoped
  content will wrap/take up the remaining space based on explicit number of lines provided.

* Aside from the differences in how lines are composed, some other directives have been renamed to
  use more explicit naming:
  * `matListIcon` is now `matListItemIcon`
  * `matListAvatar` is now `matListItemAvatar`

* Lastly, also a new directive (`matListItemMeta`) is available to put content into the meta section
  of a list item (usually the end of the list item). Previously unscoped content in a list item was
  put into the meta section.

* Recommended migration steps for common use of a list item:
  1. Change the first `matLine` to `matListItemTitle`
  2. Change all other `matLine`'s to `matListItemLine`
  3. Change all `matListIcon` to `matListItemIcon`
  4. Change all `matListAvatar` to `matListItemAvatar`
  5. Wrap all unscoped content (content outside a `matLine`) in a `matListItemMeta` container.

### Menu

* The icon for a menu item appears before the text, regardless of the order in the DOM.

  * If you have a piece of content such as an `<img>` that you want to use in place of a
    `<mat-icon>` use `ngProjectAs="mat-icon"` to project it into the icon slot.

  * If you need your icon to appear at the end of the item (not officially supported by the spec)
    you can wrap both the text and your icon in a span, for example:

    ```html
    <span>
      <span>Text</span>
      <mat-icon>end_icon</mat-icon>
    </span>
    ```

* The text in menu items wraps instead of being hidden with an ellipses.

* Menu item heights are no longer capped at `48px`.

* Menu elevation starts from level 8, instead of level 4.

### Option / Optgroup

* Long options now wrap instead of truncating with an ellipsis.

* Option heights are no longer capped at `48px`.

### Paginator

* The form-field inside of `mat-paginator` only supports the `appearance` options offered by the new
  form-field (`fill` and `outline`).

### Progress Bar

* Visibility on internal elements is now set to `visible`. Setting `visibility: hidden` will no
  longer hide all internal elements. Instead, style it with `opacity: 0`, `display: none`, or
  remove it completely with `ngIf`.

* Height is always set to 4px and does not get shorter or taller using `height` styles.

### Progress Spinner

* Host element is no longer `display: block` which may affect layout. To fix layout issues add
  `display: block` back to the element.

### Radio

* Radio button labels are no longer `width: 100%`. This helps prevent users from accidentally
  selecting a radio when clicking on whitespace that appears inert on the page.

* Labels are smaller and further away from the radio button to align with the Material Design spec.

* The touch target is now much larger and more accessible. Be sure to allow enough space in your
  layout so that the touch target does not overlap other components. If you are not concerned with
  accessibility you can match the previous size by using density -1 for the radio.

  ```scss
  @use '@angular/material' as mat;
  @include mat.radio-density(-1);
  ```

### Select

* `MatSelect` no longer aligns the selected option in the dropdown menu with the trigger text.

* Long options now wrap instead of truncating.

* Option heights are no longer capped at `48px`.

* Option list now has an `8px` top and bottom padding.

* Option list animation has changed.

* Previously the dropdown menu width could be wider than the parent form-field, but now the dropdown
  is the same width as the form-field

### Slide Toggle

* To improve accessibility, the MDC-based version uses `<button role="switch">` to represent the
  toggle rather than `<input type="checkbox">`. Slide toggle will no longer respond to native form
  validation. Consider alternative approaches to form validation.

* The touch target is much larger and more accessible. Be sure to allow enough space in your
  layout so that the touch target does not overlap other components. If you are not concerned with
  accessibility you can match the previous size by using density -1 for the slide-toggle.

  ```scss
  @use '@angular/material' as mat;
  @include mat.slide-toggle-density(-1);
  ```

* The label is closer to the enabled toggle

### Slider

* Sliders now work with mobile device screen readers.

* The slider template API has changed from a single `<mat-slider>` element to a `<mat-slider>`
  element which contains one or two `<input>` elements (depending on whether the slider should)
  be a standard or range slider. E.g.

  ```html
    <!-- Single slider -->
    <mat-slider>
      <input matSliderThumb>
    </mat-slider>

    <!-- Range slider -->
    <mat-slider>
      <input matSliderStartThumb>
      <input matSliderEndThumb>
    </mat-slider>
  ```

* The new `discrete` property on the `<mat-slider>` now controls whether the slider has tick marks
  and a value indicator tooltip. It replaces `thumbLabel`.

  ```html
  <!-- Before -->
  <mat-slider thumbLabel></mat-slider>

  <!-- After -->
  <mat-slider discrete>
    <input matSliderThumb>
  </mat-slider>
  ```

* The `tickInterval` property has been removed. To switch to the new API, use `showTickMarks` to
  create a slider with tick marks, and the interval for your tick marks will match your slider's
  `step`. The `tickInterval` property is under consideration to be added back in future releases.

  ```html
  <!-- Before -->
  <mat-slider tickInterval="5" step="5"></mat-slider>

  <!-- After -->
  <mat-slider step="5" showTickMarks>
    <input matSliderThumb>
  </mat-slider>
  ```

* The `displayValue` property has been removed. The suggested alternative for controlling the
  value indicator text is to provide a function via `displayWith`.

  ```html
  <!-- Before -->
  <mat-slider [displayValue]="myDisplayValue"></mat-slider>

  <!-- After -->
  <mat-slider [displayWith]="myDisplayWithFn">
    <input matSliderThumb>
  </mat-slider>
  ```

* The `valueText` property is now removed in favor of directly using the native input's
  aria-valuetext or providing a `displayWith` function.

  ```html
  <!-- Before -->
  <mat-slider [valueText]="myValueText"></mat-slider>

  <!-- After (Option 1) -->
  <mat-slider>
    <input [attr.aria-valuetext]="myValueText" matSliderThumb>
  </mat-slider>

  <!-- After (Option 2) -->
  <mat-slider [displayWith]="myDisplayWithFn">
    <input matSliderThumb>
  </mat-slider>
  ```

* The slider API has also changed such that there are two new components: `MatSliderThumb` and
  `MatSliderRangeThumb`. They provide the following properties:
  - `@Input() value: number`
  - `@Output() valueChange: EventEmitter<number>`
  - `@Output() dragEnd: EventEmitter<MatSliderDragEvent>`
  - `@Output() dragStart: EventEmitter<MatSliderDragEvent>`
  - `percentage: number`
    And the following methods:
  - `blur`
  - `focus`

* To accommodate range sliders, the implementation has changed from the `<mat-slider>` element being
  the form control to the `<mat-slider>` element containing 1-2 `<input>` elements (the slider
  "thumbs") that act as the form control(s). The value, associated events (`input`, `change`), and
  labels (`aria-label`) now live on the `<input>` elements instead.

* Vertical sliders and inverted sliders are no longer supported, as they are no longer part of the
  Material Design spec. As a result, the `invert` and `vertical` properties have been removed.

### Snack Bar

* For simple, text-based snack-bars, there are no significant changes.

* For simple snack-bars with an action button, they use the MDC-based mat-button, so your
  application will need to include the Sass theming mixin for the MDC-based button.

* For snack-bars that use custom structured content (if you call `MatSnackBar.openFromComponent` or
  `MatSnackBar.openFromTemplate`), you should use the following new directives to annotate your
  content:
  * `matSnackBarLabel` to mark the text displayed to users
  * `matSnackBarActions` to mark the element containing the action buttons
  * `matSnackBarAction` to mark individual action buttons
  * If you do not specify any of these directives, it will treat the entire custom component /
    template as text.

* Tests that open a snack-bar now require calling `flush()` before attempting to access the content
  of the snackbar. Updating your tests to use [component harnesses](./using-component-harnesses)
  before running the migration tool should make this transition seamless.

### Table

* All cells have a `16px` left and right padding instead of just the leftmost and rightmost cells
  having a padding of `24px`.

* Header cells have the same color and text size as the data rows instead of having more grayish and
  smaller text.

* Cell text no longer wraps by default. Cell wrapping can be enabled by applying
  `white-space: normal` to the table cells.

* Row height is `52px` instead of `48px`.

* Cell box-sizing is `border-box` instead of `content-box`. This may affect custom width styles.

* The table's last row does not include a bottom border row because the table is expected to have a
  border.

* The paginator property of the `MatTableDataSource` has a generic interface that matches most, but
  not all of the paginator API. You may need to explicitly type the paginator to access the full
  API, for example: `new MatTableDataSource<MyData, MatPaginator>();`

* Flex tables (`<mat-table>`) display a border on the cells instead of rows.

* Flex table (`<mat-table>`) row height is set with `height` instead of `min-height`.

### Tabs

* Header label text color matches the theme color when the tab header is selected.

* Header labels stretch to fill the container's width. This can be turned off by
  setting the `<mat-tab-group>` input `mat-stretch-tabs` to `false`.

* The `<mat-tab-nav-bar>` requires a reference to a `<mat-tab-nav-panel>` using the `tabPanel`
  input. The `<mat-tab-nav-panel>` must wrap the content connected to the nav-bar. This allows the
  component to provide correct labeling for assistive technology.

  ```html
  <!-- Before -->
  <mat-tab-nav-bar>...</mat-tab-nav-bar>

  <!-- After -->
  <mat-tab-nav-bar [tabPanel]="tabPanel">...</mat-tab-nav-bar>
  <mat-tab-nav-panel #tabPanel>...</mat-tab-nav-panel>
  ```

### Tooltip

* Background color is opaque instead of slightly transparent. This improves accessibility.

* Default font-size is `12px` instead of `10px`.

* Line height is `normal` instead of `16px`.

* Text overflow is `ellipsis` instead of `clip`.

* There is a new minimum width of `40px`.

* Text alignment for single line tooltips is `center`. Multi-line tooltips use `left` alignment.
